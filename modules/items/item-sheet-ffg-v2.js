/**
 * @deprecated Collapsed alias of {@link ItemSheetFFG} (V2-full migration,
 * Stage 3.7). The former V1/V2 item-sheet split is gone: both names now resolve
 * to the same native ApplicationV2 sheet, and the `v2` class / `scrollY` /
 * initial-tab differences that used to live here are folded into
 * `ItemSheetFFG.DEFAULT_OPTIONS`.
 *
 * This empty alias is retained for ONE release so that existing worlds whose
 * documents carry `flags.core.sheetClass === "ffg.ItemSheetFFGV2"` keep
 * resolving without a data migration. Its registration in `swffg-main.js` is
 * kept (without `makeDefault`) for the same reason. Remove both in the release
 * after V2-full lands. See
 * docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-31-v2-full-migration.md.
